Wintermute Networking Module (WntrNtwk)
----------------------------

1. Introduction

This library contains the networking ability of Wintermute. It allows it to
connect to networks and also emit one of its one, called an Angelnet. The
specification for the Angelnet, and thus WntrNtwk, is still under heavy
revision. The code you see in this branch is subject to *drastically* change
without notice.

2. About the Specification

The specification to WntrNtwk can be found on the Synthetic Intellect
Institute's Wiki at <http://www.thesii.org/wiki>.

3. Reporting and Contributing to the Cause

We here at the Synthetic Intellect Institute, the makers and maintainers
of Wintermute, welcome all. If you want to chat with the guys responsible
for Wintermute or the Institute, drop us a message at <contact@thesii.org> or
send us a message to our mailing list at <sii@lists.launchpad.net>. We hope to
